* The app creates several buttons automatically on load with different Pokemon names on them.

* Pressing a button creates an AJAX query to Giphy API with the Pokemon's name as the search query.  

* The first ten GIFs returned by the query will be displayed above the buttons.

* Users can add more buttons by typing a Pokemon name into the text field and clicking the search button. These buttons will query Giphy API with the user's Pokemon name as the search query.
